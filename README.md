# Incorrect Variable Name in balanceOf Function

This Solidity code demonstrates a common error: using an incorrect variable name in a function. The `balanceOf` function should return the balance of a given address from the `balanceOf` mapping, but instead it mistakenly uses a variable named `balances`, resulting in unexpected behavior.

The bug is located in the `balanceOf` function, and the solution involves simply correcting the variable name.  This highlights the importance of careful variable naming and attention to detail when writing Solidity code.
